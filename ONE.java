<!-- 📌 80/20 Time Complexity Mastery Table

If you know these 8 complexity classes (and when they’re good or bad), you can ace most interview + CP problems.

Big-O	Name	When to Use	Max N Possible (CP)	Example Problems

O(1)	Constant	Direct formula, hash lookups	10^18+	Check if a number is even, access array element

O(log N)	Logarithmic	Divide & conquer	10^18	Binary search

O(√N)	Root-time	Number theory	10^10	Check prime by trial division

O(N)	Linear	Single loop, basic traversal	10^7	Find max in array

O(N log N)	Log-linear	Sorting, efficient searches	10^6	Merge sort, sorting array

O(N²)	Quadratic	Nested loops, brute force on small N	10^3	All pairs, Floyd-Warshall on small N

O(2^N)	Exponential	Subset generation, brute-force recursion	N ≤ 20	Traveling salesman brute force

O(N!)	Factorial	All permutations	N ≤ 10	Generate all permutations

O(1) → Constant time (super fast)

O(log N) → Logarithmic (fast for big inputs)

O(N) → Linear (slower than log, but still manageable)

O(N²) → Quadratic (can be deadly for large inputs)

O(2ⁿ) → Exponential (avoid unless you like pain) -->
